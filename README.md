# sqool
This is an exercise I completed as a student at hackreactor.

# Set up
you will use the school.db file in the root directory of this repo. From inside the root directory of this repo do sqlite3 school.db. This will start up an interactive SQLite terminal, with the already populated tables from school.db loaded into the session.

# Goal
Get familiar with Querying the database with SELECT, Filtering rows with WHERE, WHERE pattern matching with LIKE, Limiting WHERE to a defined set with IN, Using IN to compose subqueries, Selecting from multiple tables, Advanced filtering with multi-table SELECT, INNER JOIN, and Join Tables.
